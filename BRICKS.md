# 🧱 BRICKS.md

**🧱 We build strong — one brick at a time. Let’s keep stacking. 🚀**

This document tracks our big ideas, improvements, next steps, and vision.
Each brick is an actionable piece of the wall we’re building together.

## ✅ Foundation Bricks — Done 🧱

- ✔️ Never trust client input — validate all DTOs server-side
- ✔️ Global HttpExceptionFilter for REST errors
- ✔️ Dead letter queue (DLQ) for logs that fail after all retries
- ✔️ Log rotation by date or max file size
- ✔️ All backend DTOs documented with API descriptions/examples
- ✔️ Env variable validation (DB_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.)
- ✔️ NODE_ENV=production enforced in prod
- ✔️ synchronize: true disabled in TypeORM prod
- ✔️ Job retries with exponential backoff
- ✔️ Bull Board at /admin/queues for visibility
- ✔️ QueueEvents listener for failed jobs
- ✔️ Graceful shutdown (onApplicationShutdown) drains workers safely
- ✔️ Health checks for BullMQ, Redis, and TypeORM
- ✔️ Router module refactored to router.ts
- ✔️ Logging S3 events
- ✔️ Fallback for unexpected non-HTTP errors
- ✔️ Monitor BullMQ for stuck/blocked jobs
- ✔️ DB connection pooling tuned (maxQueryExecutionTime)
- ✔️ Workers drain before exit, logs flushed
- ✔️ AsyncLocalStorage or cls-hooked for request scoping
- ✔️ Move profile → user_profile for clarity
- ✔️ Per-route rate limits for sensitive endpoints (/auth/login, /reset)
- ✔️ Add request ID tracing end-to-end

---

## 🚧 Bricks In Progress 🧱

- Add BullMQ metrics or Prometheus integration
- Send Slack/Email/Discord alerts for critical events (failed jobs, DB loss, crash)
- Add concurrency limits for workers to protect CPU
- Expand log monitoring to detect spikes/anomalies
- Push rotated logs to cold storage (S3)

---

## 🗓️ Future Bricks 🧱

- Sign up with Google OAuth
- Add CSRF protection if using cookies for JWT
- Implement full audit logs for user actions
- Add roles/permissions/notifications tabs in user admin
- Game entity: add icon field, tags, series, genre, dev/publisher
- Normalize game_media table (icon + cover)
- Frontend: update inputs, tables, pagination, bulk selectors
- New reusable phone number & date picker components
- API versioning for smooth upgrades
- Add OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

---

## 🔒 Security Bricks 🧱

- DDOS/Abuse: request size limits, strict CORS, Helmet
- Auth brute force: stricter login rate limit, in-memory lock, optional CAPTCHA
- Cloudflare or WAF for edge protection
- Monitor unusual failed logins, store security logs
- Enforce HTTPS via proxy, manage certs with Let’s Encrypt
- CSP headers via Helmet/NGINX
- Secure cookies if JWT is cookie-based

---

## ✨ Frontend Polish Bricks 🧱

- Layout: redesign main actions dropdown (user_actions)
- Add modern table UI with flexible selectors & bulk events
- Make rows per page selector more intuitive
- Refine pagination component
- Color picker, date picker, phone input improvements
- Global component refresh for consistency

---

## ✅ How We Use This

- Add new ideas here when they come up.
- Move bricks to “Done” when finished.
- Keep reviewing and reshuffling priority — brick by brick!

✅ Logging Checklist
🎯 Goal: Clear, consistent logs that help debug, audit, and monitor your system — no blind spots.

1️⃣ HTTP Logging

- ✅ Log all incoming requests at INFO level
- ✅ method, route, statusCode, requestId, userId (if any), IP
- ✅ Keep error logs at ERROR level (already done via GlobalExceptionFilter)

2️⃣ Auth & Security

- Log successful logins: userId, IP, user agent
- Log failed logins: attempted email, IP, reason
- Log refresh token usage: userId, new access token issued
- Log password reset requests + completions
- Log account deletions or disables

3️⃣ Database

- ✅ Keep slow query logs (already using maxQueryExecutionTime)
- Keep DB connection loss or reconnect attempts in logs

4️⃣ Jobs & Queues

- Log each job: queued, processing, success, failed (with reason)
- Log DLQ entries when jobs fail after all retries
- Log job retries

5️⃣ File Storage

- Log successful file uploads (who uploaded, filename, size)
- Log deletions
- Log S3 upload results (success/failure)

6️⃣ Emails

- Log all SendGrid sends: recipient, template, status
- Log SendGrid failures (response, message ID)

7️⃣ Scheduled Tasks

- Log when daily log uploader runs
- Log what files were uploaded & deleted locally
- Log failures (e.g., if S3 upload fails)

8️⃣ Admin & Critical Domain Events

- Log CRUD for sensitive entities (games, roles, permissions)
- Log who made the change, old vs new values if practical
- Log bulk operations (e.g., batch user deletions)

9️⃣ Startup & Shutdown

- Log app startup: version, port, env
- Log failed dependency connections (DB, Redis, S3)
- Log graceful shutdown steps

✅ Best Practices

- Always include: requestId, userId, IP where possible.
- Keep logs structured & consistent.
- Use the LogService as a single entry point.
- Use your BullMQ processor to push older logs to S3.
